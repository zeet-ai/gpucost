### **Why?**

Because it's frustrating to compare GPU SKUs across all the providers, and then once you have, its hard to keep track of who has the best deal.

### **Who?**

It was started by [Zeet.co](https://zeet.co?utm_content=gpucost&utm_campaign=GPUCost&utm_source=GPUCost&utm_medium=post), and awaits your improvements [on GitHub](https://github.com/zeet-ai/gpucost).
