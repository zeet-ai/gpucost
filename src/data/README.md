# Unlocking the Power of NVIDIA GPUs: A Deep Dive into Precision Modes and Tensor Cores

## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) frameworks have traditionally used varying levels of precision to perform calculations. While higher precision offers greater numerical accuracy, it often comes at the cost of computational speed and memory usage. NVIDIA, in its newer generation of GPU architectures, has introduced some innovative solutions to balance this trade-off. This article explores the different precision modes available, the revolutionary Tensor Float (TF32) mode, and the concept of Tensor Cores to accelerate matrix operations.

## Standard Precision Modes in ML Frameworks

Machine Learning frameworks usually support three primary precision modes:

- **FP64 (Double Precision)**: Uses 64-bit floating-point numbers. Offers the highest level of accuracy but is computationally intensive.
- **FP32 (Single Precision)**: Utilizes 32-bit floating-point numbers. This is a balanced choice for many applications.
- **FP16 (Half Precision)**: Works with 16-bit floating-point numbers. It is less accurate but significantly faster and consumes less memory.

## The Innovation of Tensor Cores

Tensor Cores are specialized hardware units designed to accelerate matrix operations, a critical aspect of machine learning computations. These Tensor Cores are built on top of the CUDA cores and are specifically optimized for performance in ML tasks.

In the context of new-generation GPUs, performance is often characterized in terms of both General-Purpose GPU Computing (CUDA) performance and Tensor Core performance.

## Introducing Tensor Float (TF32)

Tensor Float, or TF32, is a 19-bit floating-point format introduced in NVIDIA's newer GPU architectures. What sets TF32 apart is its ability to offer a compromise between speed and accuracy.

From a developer's perspective, you continue to specify calculations in either FP32 or FP16. The NVIDIA CUDA driver internally translates these to TF32 operations where applicable. This internal switch to TF32 is seamless, thus providing computational speed without requiring code changes.

## Mixed-Precision Training: Best of Both Worlds

To mitigate the downsides of lower precision, NVIDIA also advocates for mixed-precision training. The concept can be understood with the abstract activation function `weight (W) * input (I) = output (O)`.

- **In FP32 Mode**: \( \text{FP32 Weight} \times \text{FP32 Input} = \text{FP32 Output} \)
- **In Mixed-Precision Mode**: \( \text{FP16 Weight} \times \text{FP16 Input} = \text{FP32 Output} \)

In mixed-precision training, the forward and backward pass calculations use FP16 data to gain speed. However, the gradients and weights are stored in the more accurate FP32 format to maintain numerical stability.

## Tensor Compute with Sparsity

Sparsity is an optimization technique aiming to improve computational efficiency by eliminating the need to store or operate on zero values in the network. Despite its promise, sparsity poses challenges in acceleration, accuracy, and workflow. Specifically, fine-grained, unstructured sparsity struggles to take advantage of efficient hardware acceleration techniques. Accuracy can also suffer when implementing sparsity, especially with aggressive pruning methods. Furthermore, the application of sparsity isn't universal; the efficacy can vary based on the specific network architecture, task, and other hyperparameters.

## Understanding Effective Performance Metrics

To fully understand the performance capabilities for AI and ML applications, it's essential to consider the combined effects of various optimizations discussed earlier. Here's how to assess effective performance:

### Types of Published Performance Metrics

- **CUDA**: Includes FP64, FP32, FP16 modes.
- **Tensor Core**: Operates on TF32, FP64, FP32, FP16 modes.
- **Tensor Core with Sparsity (TensorS)**: Also works on TF32, FP64, FP32, FP16 modes but optimized with sparsity techniques.

### Categories for Calculating Effective Performance

To analyze effective performance, we introduce two new categories:

- **Combined (Lossless)**: This accounts for GPUs that may lack certain compute modes. Higher precision modes can be used to achieve the intended lower precision calculations.
- **Effective (Lossy)**: This represents real-world performance where certain optimizations trade off precision for speed.

#### Standard Calculations (Combined Lossless)

- **Combined CUDA FP64**: Equal to CUDA FP64
- **Combined CUDA FP32**: Maximum of CUDA FP32 and CUDA FP64
- **Combined CUDA FP16**: Maximum of CUDA FP16 and CUDA FP32

#### Calculations with Tensor Core (Combined Lossless)

- **Combined Tensor FP64**: Maximum of Tensor FP64 and Combined CUDA FP64
- **Combined Tensor FP32**: Maximum of Tensor FP32, Combined CUDA FP32, and Combined Tensor FP64
- **Combined Tensor TF32**: Maximum of Tensor TF32 and Combined Tensor FP32
- **Combined Tensor FP16**: Maximum of Tensor FP16, Combined CUDA FP16, and Combined Tensor TF32

#### Calculations with Sparse Tensor (Effective Lossy)

- **Effective AI/ML FP64**: Maximum of TensorS FP64 and Combined Tensor FP64
- **Effective AI/ML FP32**: Maximum among TensorS FP32, TensorS TF32, Combined Tensor FP32, and Effective AI/ML FP64
- **Effective AI/ML FP16**: Maximum among TensorS FP16, Combined Tensor FP16, and Effective AI/ML FP32

By default, our benchmark results will display these calculated effective AI/ML performance metrics.
